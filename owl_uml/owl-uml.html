</p><h2>Purpose of this document</h2>

This document describes a UML-based presentation syntax of the web ontology
language OWL. OWL is text-based; the UML presentation syntax uses,
where possible, the graphical conventions of the UML class and object
diagrams. The presentation syntax could make it easier for main-stream
software developers to understand OWL and could also be used by OWL
editing tools. In places where a graphical notation is impossible, the
language will have to revert to OWL itself, in a similar manner as OCL
(the Object Constraint Language) is used for regular UML. 
<p>
@@Add a few lines about ontologies as shared data models, etc.@@
</p><p>
This document assumes basic knowledge of UML class and object diagrams. 
We use the UML notation as described in the UML User Guide [1]. 
Note that there are syntax variations between UML sources. 

</p><h1>Terminology</h1>

OWL is based on the data model of RDF. This data model distinguishes
three basic notions: "resource", "literal" and "property". 
<p>
A resource can be  anything that has a URI. A 
literal is a data value, such as a string or a
number. Loosely speaking, resource and literal correspond to the UML
notion of, respectively, object and value. OWL defines "classes" of resources,
similar to UML object classes. 
</p><p>
A property defines a directed relationship from a resource to a
resource or literal.  OWL distinguishes two types of properties: (1)
an "object property" linking a resource to a resource, and (2) a
"datatype property" linking a resource to a literal. Loosely speaking,
an object property corresponds to a UML association and a datatype
property to a UML  attribute.

</p><h2>UML notations for OWL Lite</h2>
 
<h3>Classes and subclasses</h3> 

An OWL class is shown in a similar fashion as a UML class. Note that
ontologies typically do not specify class behavior, so the operation
compartment will stay empty. Classes may have subclasses. This is
shown through a UML generalization (open triangle arrow).

instead. This implies that, by default, classes are primitive.]

<h3>Datatype properties</h3>

Datatype properties (i.e. properties linking an object to a literal)
are typically shown as class attributes of the class that acts as domain
of the property. OWL uses XML Schema to define
datatypes. For example, <code>xsd:NonNegativeNumber</code> refers to
the the XML Schema datatype <code>NonNegativeNumber</code>. 
<p>
Property cardinality is indicated in UML by a postfix of the attribute
name, e.g. <code>age[1..1]</code> is a single-valued required
attribute, and <code>phoneNumber[0..*]</code> defines an optional and
multi-valued attribute. 
</p><p>
Alternatively, OWL
allows the specification of an enumeration of data values  as value
range for a property. For this we use the UML notation for an
enumeration datatype [1, p. 59]: the datatype is represented through a
class box labeled with the <code>&lt;&lt;enumeration&gt;&gt;</code>
stereotype. The data values are listed in the attribute box. The
figure below shows an example of this for the enumeration datatype
<code>Height</code>. Prefixing the data values with the datatype (as
done in the figure) is strictly speaking not part of the UML syntax.

An alternative UML representation for datatype properties is to use an
UML association (see below). This notation is needed if one wants to
express a <code>subproperty</code> relation between datatype properties. 
<p>
[TODO: UniquelyIdentifyingProperty: either add constraint or show as association]

</p><h3>Object properties</h3>

An object property is shown as a binary UML association between
classes. As object properties have a direction (from-to) the UML
convention of an arrowhead indicatiing this direction should be used
(see the figure below). 
<p>
Cardinality (in UML terminology: multiplicity) can be
defined for both ends of the relation. This allows specification of
the OWL cardinality definitions:
</p><ul>
<li>Required property: a minimum cardinality of "1" for the "to-class". 
</li><li>Single/multi-valued property: "1" respectively "*" as the maximum cardinality for the
"to-class". 
</li><li>Unique property: a "0..1" or "1..1" cardinality for the
"from-class".   
</li></ul>

The figure below shows an example of an object property
<code>HasParent</code>. The arrowhead following the association name
indicates the direction of the property (in this example the domain and
range are of the same class). The cardinality is specified in the OWL
Lite manner. In UML it would have been easy to restrict the cardinality
of the "to-class" to "2..2".

<h3>Subproperty relation</h3>

A subproperty relation 
can be shown in UML only if the property is modelled as an
association. This may be a reason to choose an "association" notation
instead of an "attribute" notation for a datatype property. In that
case you should make sure that the "to-class" of the association has a
UML stereotype <code>&lt;&lt;datatype&gt;&gt;</code> (or one of its
specializations). 
<p>
The clearest way of modelling a subproperty relation is to model the
associations involved as a UML association class (a standard UML
mechanism for treating associations as classes). The association
classes can then be linked with a UML generalization (as between
regular classes). One can add a custom stereotype
<code>&lt;&lt;subproperty&gt;&gt;</code> for clarity purposes.  
</p><p>
The figure below shows an example subproperty
relation. The property <code>HasMother</code> is defined as a
subproperty of <code>HasParent</code>.

</p><p>
</p></center>

<h3>Transitive property</h3>

The association-class notation can also be used to indicate that a
property is transitive. For this purpose, we assume there
exists a metaclass <code>TransitiveProperty</code> (probably defined
as a subclass of <code>Property</code>) of which the association is an
instance. The instance-of relation is shown in UML through a
dependency with an <code>&lt;&lt;instance&gt;&gt;</code>
stereotype. The figure below shows an example of this for a
<code>HasAncestor</code> property.

</p><p>
</p></center>

<h3>Disjointness and identity</h3>

Disjointness between classes can be shown with the predefined UML
constraint <code>Disjoint</code> [1, p. 143]. A constraint is shown as
a UML annotation with the stereotype
<code>&lt;&lt;constraint&gt;&gt;</code>. The constraint should be
linked with a dependency relation to the classes concerned.

</p><p>
</p></center>

The OWL language constructs for identity (<code>SameClassAs</code>
<code>SamePropertyAs</code> and <code>SameIndividualAs</code> can be
defined in a similar fashion, namely by introducing a UML constraint with
the same name (unlike <code>disjoint</code>, these are not predefined
by UML).

<p>

<em><code>Person</code> and <code>Human</code> denote the same class</em>
</p><p>
</p></center>
   
<h3>Defined classes</h3>

Defined classes are classes with necessary and sufficient properties
to determine class membership. 
<p>
A defined class is shown as a regular UML class with a stereotype
<code>&lt;&lt;defined class&gt;&gt;</code>.

</p><p>
<em>A "defined class" is shown through a UML class stereotype</em>
</p><p>
</p></center>


<h3>Individuals</h3>

Individuals are shown with the UML notation for objects. The object is
linked with an "instance" dependency to the class of the
individual. Property values are shown as either UML attribute values
or as UML links (UML terminology for an instance of an association). 

<center>
<p>
<img src="owl-uml_fichiers/owl-individual.jpg">
</p><p>
<em>Two individuals of the class <code>Human</code></em>
</p><p>
</p></center>


<h3>Enumerated classes</h3>

Enumerated classes can be shown as a class together with the enumerated
individuals represented as UML objects. 
The number of instances of a class (class cardinality)
can be shown in the UML class box by placing a number
restriction in the right-upper corner. The example below defines a
class for the so-called "Da Ponte" opera's composed by Mozart. There
are precisely three individuals in this class. 
<center>
<p>
<img src="owl-uml_fichiers/owl-enumeration-class.jpg">
</p><p>
<em>An enumerated class. The number "3" at the upper-right corer of the
class box specifies that this class has exactly three instances. </em>
</p><p>
</p></center>

The example above shows also an example of a class-scoped
attribute (the underlined attribute <code>librettist</code>), 
which indicates that the attribute value is the same for all instances of a
class. In the example "Lorenzo da Ponte" is the librettist of all the
opera's in this class and Mozart is the composer 
(the fact that these attribute  values 
are repeated in the figure  for each
instance is a bug/feature of the drawing tool used).
