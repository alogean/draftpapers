\begin{abstract}
In this article we present an exemple of model to model transformation using openArchitectureWare. In our exemple the physical model of a
repository (JAXR) is transformed to an object oriented logical model (ecore). This new OO-logical model is then used by a generator to
produce diverse artefacts. The component in charge of the mapping of system A to a system B is often call an adapter. Instead of hard coding
this adapter we propose to use at runtime a m2m transformation interpreted by a model transformation language interpreter. We will then
discuss about different aspekts of the running of a generator at rune-time.
